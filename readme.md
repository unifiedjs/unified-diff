## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] plugin to ignore unrelated lint messages in a CI.

**unified** is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees
(ASTs).
**vfile** is the virtual file interface used in unified which manages messages.
This is a unified plugin that filters messages on the vfile.

## When should I use this?

You can use this plugin when you are dealing with a large, existing project.

Using tools that check whether things follow a style guide is typically very
useful.
However, it can be hard to start using something in a large existing project.
This plugin helps, because it ignores messages that occur in lines that are not
touched by a PR in a CI.
When this plugin is used outside of a supported CIs, it doesnâ€™t do anything.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, or 18.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install unified-diff
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import unifiedDiff from 'https://esm.sh/unified-diff@4'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import unifiedDiff from 'https://esm.sh/unified-diff@4?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our document `example.md` contains:

```markdown
This is an an example.
```

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: `an an` is a typo.

â€¦and our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import unifiedDiff from 'unified-diff'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkStringify from 'remark-stringify'
import remarkRetext from 'remark-retext'
import retextEnglish from 'retext-english'
import retextRepeatedWords from 'retext-repeated-words'
import retextIndefiniteArticle from 'retext-indefinite-article'

const file = unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(
    remarkRetext,
    unified()
      .use(retextEnglish)
      .use(retextRepeatedWords)
      .use(retextIndefiniteArticle)
  )
  .use(remarkStringify)
  .use(unifiedDiff)
  .process(await read('example.md'))

console.error(reporter(file))
process.exit(file.messages.length > 0 ? 1 : 0)
```

â€¦and our Travis configuration `.travis.yml` contains:

```yml
# â€¦
script:
- npm test
- node example.js
# â€¦
```

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: an equivalent GH Actions workflow file is also supported.

Then, say someone creates a PR which adds the following diff:

```diff
diff --git a/example.md b/example.md
index 360b225..5a96b86 100644
--- a/example.md
+++ b/example.md
@@ -1 +1,3 @@
 This is an an example.
+
+Some more more text. A error.
```

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: `more more` and `A` before `error` are typos.

When run in CI, weâ€™ll see the following printed on **stderr**(4).

```txt
example.md
   3:6-3:15  warning  Expected `more` once, not twice   retext-repeated-words      retext-repeated-words
  3:22-3:23  warning  Use `An` before `error`, not `A`  retext-indefinite-article  retext-indefinite-article

âš  2 warnings
```

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: `an an` on L1 is not included because itâ€™s unrelated to this PR.

The build exits with `1` as there are messages, thus failing CI.
The user sees this and amends the PR to the following:

```diff
diff --git a/example.md b/example.md
index 360b225..5a96b86 100644
--- a/example.md
+++ b/example.md
@@ -1 +1,3 @@
 This is an an example.
+
+Some more text. An error.
```

This time our lint task exits successfully, even though L1 would normally emit
an error, but itâ€™s unrelated to the PR.

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `unifiedDiff`.

### `unified().use(unifiedDiff)`

Ignore unrelated messages in GitHub Actions and Travis.

There are no options.
If thereâ€™s a `TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE`, `GITHUB_BASE_REF` and `GITHUB_HEAD_REF`, or
`GITHUB_SHA` environment variable, then this plugin runs, otherwise it does
nothing.

###### To do

*   [ ] Add support for other CIs (ping if you want to work on this)
*   [ ] Add non-CI support (Iâ€™m not sure how though)

PRs welcome!
